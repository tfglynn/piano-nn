This repository contains the code, training checkpoints, and some generations of a model I've been building to make MIDI music.
The model is similar to [Music Transformer](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer) and [MuseNet](https://openai.com/research/musenet).
I've written about it on my blog: [[1]](https://halfofknowing.com/aimuse.html), [[2]](https://halfofknowing.com/aimuse2.html).
